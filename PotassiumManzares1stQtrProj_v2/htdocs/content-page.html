      <h1>Conflicts and Wars</h1>
      <p>Since the dawn of human history, we have been fighting over
        land and resources. Technological progress also meant deadlier
        weapons and greater loss of life, especially today with modern
        weaponry many people in the past would see as magic or alien.
        These weapons are exactly what might lead to our demise, as
        they continue to get ever more complex and effective.</p>

      <h1>War in Ukraine</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The War in Ukraine was started on February 24th 2022, when
        Russian ground forces were ordered to invade the country. These
        forces were gradually built up since late 2021, and were estimated
        to be 120,000 strong (not including soldiers from Belarus,
        hired mercenaries, and volunteers from Russian allies). This
        act of aggression was condemned internationally due to breaches
        in international law and previous agreements on Ukrainian national
        security.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The modern country of Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union
        in 1991, after hundreds of years under Russian control. This new repubic, and
        many post-Soviet countries for that matter had to make an important decision:
        Pursue closer relations with the West or stick with Russia? Ukraine tried its
        hand with both, improving relations with the European Union while also
        being part of the Russian-led CSTO military alliance. In 1996, Ukraine gave back its
        nuclear weapons to Russia, which had been quietly stockpiled after the collapse of
        the Soviet Union, with Russia, USA, and NATO guaranteeing "Ukraine's territorial
        integrity" at the Bucharest Agreement. However, disaster struck the country in 2014.
        Pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych rejected a trade agreement with the European Union, greatly angering the
        Ukrainian people. He was eventually ousted from power
        and exiled to Russia after several protests collectively known as the "Revolution
        of Dignity". Russia proceeded to take advantage of Ukraine's instability and
        took over the Crimean Peninsula which hosted the major port of Sevastopol, while
        also supporting pro-Russian seperatists in the Donbas region of Ukraine.</p>
      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <p>The War in Ukraine has killed several thousand soldiers and civilians,
        destroying many homes and critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, etc.
        Millions more were forced to flee to neighboring countries and beyond, such
        as Poland, Romania, Moldova, and Slovakia, creating somewhat of a refugee crisis.
        The war has also caused great suffering in occupied areas, as many Ukrainian
        civilians are starved, beaten, sometimes killed by their occupiers.</p>

      <h1>Syrian Civil War</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Syrian Civil War is a conflict within Syria between different
      armed groups with opposing political stances and motives. It started
      in mid-2011 after protests against Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad
      were met with brutality. Some anti-government forces were then mustered,
      with volunteers taking up arms. Parts of the Syrian Army also defected
      to the rebels' side, with gunfire being exchanged in several major
      cities across the country. Civil unrest continued to rise, especially
      in the northeast, where ethnic Kurds have long seeked independence.
      Seeing the dictatorial regime of Al-Assad being challenged by the rebels,
      the Kurds formed a militant group to assist in overthrowing the government,
      while some remained loyal due to promises of autonomy for Kurds after the
      war ended.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Since 1971, Syria was under control of the Assad family, namely
      Hafez Al-Assad and his son Bashar Al-Assad, who is the current president
      of Syria. Many rigged referendums have been held, where the Syrian
      Ba'ath Party always won. The people of Syria finally snapped in 2011,
      with protests in many of the country's major cities like Homs, Aleppo,
      Latakia, and the capital city of Damascus. The government cracked down
      on the protesters, using lethal force to disperse them, which pushed
      some to the limits. They created the Free Syrian Army, a rebel group
      set on returning democracy to Syria by ousting Bashar Al-Assad from
      power. Soon, ethnic Kurds living in Syria took advantage of the
      government's weakness and declared support for the rebels, sending
      armed militiamen to assist. Some Kurds remained loyal however, as
      the government coerced them to fight against the rebels and in
      return they would get autonomy after the war ended. Terrorist groups
      in the region also sprang up, notably ISIS which is an acronym that
      means the "Islamic State in Syria". Other affiliated terrorist groups
      like Al-Qaeda did not support the government or rebels, but rather
      wanted to bring Syria under their complete control, and use it as a
      base for further expansion in the Middle East. After American president
      Obama declared support for the FSA, NATO shipments of weapons began
      arriving in the country, while Russia started supporting the Syrian
      government forces to subvert American influence in the region.
      After nearly 12 years, the Syrian Civil War rages on with both
      sides unwilling to back down.</p>
      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <p>The Syrian Civil War has caused a dire humanitarian crisis, with
      millions of Syrians fleeing to neighboring countries. The remaining
      Syrians are forced to live in horrid conditions, as most infrastructure
      in cities and the countryside was destroyed by fighting. Diseases ravage
      the country, since most hospitals are low on medical supplies, while
      electricity and running water are barely available.</p>
