        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>While the previous three pages have predicted doom and gloom, it is not too late
            for humanity. If we manage to unite all eight billion humans to one cause, we
            will be able to solve all of these problems given enough attention and time.

            <h1>The United Nations</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Formed in 1947, the United Nations is an international organization that
                is constituted by the world's 195 countries and 2 observer states (Palestine
                and the Vatican). Today it is still serves as an example of how countries
                can work together to solve world issues.
            </p>
            <h2>Partner Organizations</h2>
            <p>The United Nations funds many initiatives worldwide to help in stopping
                conflicts and aid national governments in times of crises.
            </p>

                    <h3>UNICEF</h3>
                    <p>With a mission to protect children around the world,
                        UNICEF aims to uphold children's rights and keep them safe
                        from abuse.

                    <h3>Peacekeeping Missions</h3>
                    <p>The UN Peacekeeping missions around the world aim to prevent
                        conflicts from starting, especially in areas with tension.
                        Although armed with modern weapons, they are ordered not to
                        open fire unless they are fired at first.

                    <h3>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</h3>
                    <p>The IMF lets countries loan or borrow money for their own
                        development, and allows countries to prevent themselves
                        from going into bankruptcy, thus maintaining economic
                        stability in the region.

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>The United Nations has thus far proven effective in stopping most conflicts.
                Although some major improvements need to be made, especially in terms of
                enforcement of international law, the UN is a better solution to disputes
                compared to any war. It has also helped in maintaining global stability,
                and helps in giving smaller countries a bigger say in international affairs.
            </p>
            <h2>Controversies</h2>
            <p>In recent times, the United Nations has come under criticism after it couldn't
                prevent issues such as the escalation of the War in Ukraine or border
                skirmishes along the India-China border. Critics have also pointed out the
                UN's ineffectiveness when the international community does not unilaterally
                agree on one decision, usually ending when one of the "Big Five" (Permanent
                members of the UN Security Council; USA, Russia, China, UK and France) veto
                a UN vote when it is in opposition to their goals.
