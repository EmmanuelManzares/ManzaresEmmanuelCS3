    <h1>SERIOUS SOCIAL STRUGGLES - ENVIRONMENT AND NATURE</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="title-panel">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Ever since humans learned how to harness coal and fossil fuels, our species has irreversibly
      changed our planet. In modern times, the rate of destruction far outpaces the rate at which
      nature can replenish itself. With forests burned, oceans trashed, and air polluted, it is only
      a matter of time before our actions become our own undoing. Can humanity reverse the damage it
      has done?

      <h1>Forest Fires</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Worldwide, forest fires are becoming more and more prevalent as temperatures rise.
        In places such as California and Australia, they are becoming so common that there is even
        "forest fire season", where the number of forest fires drastically increases. There are
        both man-made and natural causes to these fires, but human activity causes them more often.
      </p>
      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>Forest fires mainly occur in forests with thick undergrowth and in areas with hot
        and arid climates. Below is a map of where forest fires occur in the United States,
        with darker-colored areas having larger and more common forest fires on average.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/forest-fire-map.png">
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>Forest fires can start for a number of reasons. Natural causes of forest fires are : </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Lightning Strikes</h3>
          <p>Lightning can strike during a storm and cause forest fires.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>High Temperature and Low Humidity</h3>
          <p>If the environment is hot and arid, forest fires are more likely to happen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Flammable Plants</h3>
          <p>Certain species of plants, such as eucalyptus trees as well as shrubs and small bushes
            easily burn and can spread forest fires quickly.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, humans are causing more forest fires than ever. What's worse is more often than not,
        we start these forest fires intentionally. Land clearing is a big issue in many countries such
        as Brazil, Australia, and the Philippines.</p>
      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <p>Forest fires burn down hectare upon hectare of forests and disrupt the local ecosystem by
        eliminating both food and shelter for the animals living there, not to mention the amount
        of plant life that is destroyed in the process. This can adversely affect the natural balance
        in the region, and if the damage is too much the forest may never recover. Large fires can
        also release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, further worsening climate
        change.

      <h1>Climate Change</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Climate change is the rapid and drastic change in the environment. It is currently
        causing many issues worldwide and is becoming harder and harder to stop. Below are
        the causes and effects of climate change, and how it has destroyed both natural ecosystems
        and is starting to destroy humanity as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>The main driving force behind climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases.
        These gases trap the sun's heat within the Earth's atmosphere, causing the planet to
        get hotter. Listed below are the largest sources of these greenhouse gases.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Industrial Sources</h3>
          <p>This refers to large-scale industries such as manufacturing and construction.
            Industrial sources account for over 12.4% of greenhouse gas emissions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Resource Extraction</h3>
          <p>This refers to the extraction of raw materials, such as mining and logging.
            Extracting resources accounts for over 6% of greenhouse gas emissions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Agriculture</h3>
          <p>This refers to the greenhouse gases released by farming crops as well as from
            livestock kept on farms. Agricultural sources account for 11% of greenhouse gas emissions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Natural Sources</h3>
          <p>Various natural and biological sources can also produce greenhouse gases. These include, but
            are not limited to volcanic eruptions, fires, and animals.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below is a chart that shows greenhouse gas emissions, with sources being listed along with
        the percentage of the gases released. Note that this data is exclusive to the United States.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/global-emissions.png">
      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <p>The consequences of climate change are far-reaching. Below are just some of the effects that are
        posing real problems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Rising Sea Levels</h3>
          <p>Due to rising temperatures, the world's ice caps and glaciers are starting to melt, slowly
            making the water level rise. Low elevation countries such as the Netherlands, as well as
            island nations like the Solomon Islands and the Maldives are at risk of sinking into the ocean.
            Large metropolis cities like Jakarta, Indonesia (Population: 13.7 million people),
            London, United Kingdom (Population: 10.5 million people), and Dhaka, Bangladesh
            (Population: 31.2 million people) are already sinking up to ten times as fast compared to the
            global average.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Extreme Weather Conditions</h3>
          <p>Weather phenomena such as tornadoes, typhoons, and flash floods are becoming more commonplace.
            Because of global warming, the ocean's temperature is also rising. This creates the perfect
            environment for powerful storms to grow larger and larger, which cause billions of dollars
            in damages every year.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
