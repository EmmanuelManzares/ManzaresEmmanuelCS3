    <h1>SERIOUS SOCIETAL STRUGGLES - HUMANITARIAN AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="title-panel">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>From the first empires to today's countries, social issues continue to plague
        human civilization. Social unrest, famines, epedemics, all have had a major
        impact on us. With the current problems facing the countries of the world,
        will governments and their people be able to survive the coming years?

        <h1>Authoritarianism</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Even in our modern age, some countries are still stuck in the past.
           Their people have no power, their wealth locked away from most,
           and their future entirely dependent on the decisions of a few people.
           While democracy and freedom has continually spread worldwide,
           these nations continue to follow systems that have long proven to be
           ineffective and inefficient at solving their problems in our
           ever-changing world.
        </p>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Authoritarianism is a form of government where one person, or
            a few people are in absolute control of a country. In such a system,
            rights and freedom are virtually nonexistent, and the people do not
            have any tangible power. Opposition, even in the smallest extent is
            usually severely punished.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>For most of human history, authoritarianism was commonplace. Kings,
            queens, duchies and emperors did what they saw fit without any fear
            of reprisal for their actions. They justified their rule by claiming
            either to be related to God, or to be appointed by God to rule over 
            the people. However, this all changed in 1783 when the American
            Revolution succeeded in establishing the world's first democracy.
            Over the next three centuries, democracy spread across the world,
            with countries undergoing peaceful or violent transitions to
            new, democratic systems. However, holdovers from the past are still
            present, some possessing great influence on the world stage.
        </p>
        <h2>Relics of the Past</h2>
        <p>Below are some countries that practice authoritarianism</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>PRC (People's Republic of China)</h3>
                <img src="../images/china-flag.png" class="flag">
                <h4>Social Credit System</h4>
                <p>With the Chinese Communist Party's iron grip over China's
                    1.45 billion people, the People's Republic of China is
                    by far the largest authoritarian state in terms of
                    population. The famous "social credit score" system is used
                    by the Chinese government to identify people who are
                    out of line. Actions such as speaking against the CCP result
                    in lower social credit, whereas watching propaganda videos
                    or actively supporting the CCP will give you higher
                    social credit. In such a system, a higher social credit
                    means more benefits, and vice versa. This incentivizes
                    behavior that forces people to follow the strict regulations
                    imposed on them by the CCP.
                </p>
                <h4>Oppression</h4>
                <p>Ethnic minority groups living in China's more rural areas
                    have been facing several human rights violations and harsh
                    treatment from the central government. The Uyghurs that
                    populate China's northwestern province of Xinjiang are
                    the most famous example of this, with so-called
                    "re-education camps" being set up to facilitate the
                    imprisonment, torture, and killing of thousands of Chinese Uyghurs.

            <li>
                <h3>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea)</h3>
                <img src="../images/dprk-flag.png" class="flag">
                <h4>Brainwashing</h4>
                <p>However "democratic" the DPRK claims to be, there is no doubt that it is
                    an authoritarian state under control of the WPK (Worker's Party of Korea).
                    No matter who people vote in the country's sham elections, it is guaranteed
                    that North Korea's "supreme leader" (currently Kim Jong-un) will win.
                    The people of the aptly named "Hermit Kingdom" are shown propaganda every day,
                    praising their great leader and the achievements of North Korea's socialist
                    system over the "evil" and "greedy" capitalist system put in place by the West.
                    North Koreans are also taught from a young age that in Western nations,
                    most people wear rags and are very poor, while the few rich people live in
                    lavish mansions, not realizing that it describes their country instead.
                </p>
                <h4>A System Designed for Failure</h4>
                <p>North Korea's current political system is often compared to the Soviet Union
                    of the 1930s, during the reign of communist dictator Joseph Stalin. With a cult
                    of personality built around himself, North Korea's supreme leader does whatever
                    he wants and goes wherever he wants, with armed bodyguards following him at all
                    times. The country's military expenditure is believed to be up to 24% of North
                    Korea's tiny economy, leaving the rest to be used up by North Korean elites
                    and a miniscule portion for the people, who recieve barely enough food to survive.
                    The PRC is North Korea's main ally and is seen as the only power propping up
                    Kim Jong-un's dictatorship, funding most of North Korea's large projects, providing
                    the majority of its electricity, and keeping South Korea and the United States
                    from invading North Korea altogether. However, this system is proving to be
                    unsustainable, as the nation has faced several famines and minor disturbances in
                    the supply chain could spell disaster for North Korea and its people.
                </p>

                <p class="caption-text">North Korea regularly holds nuclear missile tests, launching
                    test missiles near the coasts of South Korea and Japan as a reminder that the

                <h3>Russian Federation (Russia)</h3>
                <img src="../images/russia-flag.png" class="flag">
                <h4>Subjugation</h4>
                <p>While Russia claims to be a democratic nation, the current president Vladimir Putin
                    has been in office since 2000. His political party, "United Russia" has repeatedly
                    won every single election, with all other political parties simply being dummy
                    parties. State-owned media propagates lies throughout the Russian people,
                    skewing data, and spreading cover-up stories for the War in Ukraine. Russian
                    police have also been known to crack down on any form of protest, and the government
                    continues to deny accusations of corruption, as well as war crimes commited against
                    Ukrainian civilians in occupied areas.
                </p>
                <h4>A Tainted Image</h4>
                <p>Following the invasion of its smaller neighbor, Russia has been isolated internationally
                    due to the sheer amount of sanctions placed on it by the West. Its only real ally is
                    Belarus, which is more-or-less its puppet state. China is Russia's only major trading
                    partner left, and many countries refuse to associate themselves with Russia, lest they
                    also be isolated from the international community. However, some Russians are unaware of this,
                    as state media continues to claim that the "special military operation" is justified
                    and will be over "soon". Many Russians living abroad are against Putin, especially after
                    general mobilization was announced, with up to a million Russians entering refuge in neighboring
                    countries.
