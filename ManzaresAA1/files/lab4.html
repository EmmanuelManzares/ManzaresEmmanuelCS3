<h2>Descriptions</h2>
<h3>"1984" by George Orwell</h3>
<p>The novel "1984" is set in that year, in an
alternate world where there are three nations fighting
for supremacy and influence worldwide. The focus of
the novel being on "Oceania", a totalitarian regime set
to control the minds of all its citizens and to swiftly
put down any form of dissent or unrest. However, one
man named "Winston Smith" finds himself questioning
the government's actions and policies, eventually
getting caught and tortured to the point where he
is forced to give up any form of rebellion.</p>
<h3>"Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury</h3>
<p>Much like "1984", "Fahrenheit 451" takes place
in a dystopian setting - the main character, "Guy Montag"
is a "fireman", however unlike a normal fireman, his
job is not to put out fires, instead he and his colleagues
are tasked to burn books as a way to repress individuality
and self-expression through writing. As time passes by,
he starts to question the morality and the justification
for the mass censorhip taking place.</p>
<h3>"Foundation" by Isaac Asimov</h3>
<p>Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" is set in a futuristic
galactic society where a new branch of mathematics has been
discovered. This new kind of math is named "psychohistory",
which is able to predict events thousands of years into
the future. Using this, a mathematician by the name of
"Hari Seldon" predicts the collapse of the Galactic Empire,
after which there is a period of 30,000 of anarchy and
violence across the galaxy before a Second Galactic Empire
is established and order is restored.</p>
