	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>
	The M4 Sherman is my favorite tank because of its effectiveness
	in both the infantry support and anti-tank role.
	While other tanks of the time such as Germany's Panzer III or Britain's Cromwell
	focused either on supporting advancing troops or destroying enemy tanks, the 
	M4 Sherman proved to be a versatile design that allowed it to do both tasks at the
	same time. The design was also cost-effective and cheap, allowing for nearly 50,000 Shermans to
	be produced.
	However, even though the M4 Sherman could perform both roles, it could not excel in either of them.
	A good description would be that it was the tank of all trades, but the master of none; a trait it
	shared with its Russian counterpart, the T-34.
	Whatever problems faced the Sherman, it is undoutebly one of the best tanks of WWII, and has
	been used in many conflicts by other countries in the years since.
