  <h1>Major Problems around the World</h1>
  <p>This page will cover the three largest problems facing
  our society today, whether natural or man-made.</p>
  <div>
	<h2>#1: War in Ukraine</h2>
	<img src="../images/ukraine-war.png">
	<p>There is no doubt that the current war in Ukraine is one of the largest, if not the largest
	worldwide issue right now. On one side is Ukraine and the West, who seek to counter Russia's influence
	in Eastern Europe, and on the other side is Russia, who wants to expand its control over the former
	territory of the Soviet Union. After 7 months of harsh fighting, thousands of soldiers and civilians have
	died, with millions more displaced from their homes and forced to flee the country. Tension continues
	to build as Russia continues its aggression while the West tries to support Ukraine as much as possible 
	without getting directly involved. The frontlines are in deadlock, with only limited offensives taking
	place. The conflict has also caused a severe decline in economic activity, especially in Eastern Europe
	where millions of Ukranian refugees are sheltering in neighboring countries like Poland and Romania.
	The West has also considerably increased their military presence in the area, and Russia continues to
	threaten them with weapons of mass destruction.</p>

	<h2>#2: Climate Change</h2>
	<img src="../images/climate-change.png">
	<p>While the War in Ukraine has caused a great loss of life, it pales in comparison to the force of
	Mother Nature. Typhoons able to uproot houses from their foundations, tsunamis flooding entire coastlines,
	and volcanic eruptions covering kilometers upon kilometers of land with dust and ash. It is clear that
	humanity is at the mercy of the planet we live on, with no way to stop natural disasters. However,
	unbeknownst to us we are contributing to the death of humans and many other life forms on Earth due
	to pollution and our current way of life. It is important we change how we treat our planet, as our
	actions may come back one day to bite us. We should remember that right now Earth is our only home,
	and we have the capability to right our wrongs and fix the planet before it is too late.</p>

	<h2>#3: Poverty and Financial Inequality</h2>
	<img src="../images/financial-inequality.png">
	<p>In our modern day and age, communication is only a click away and we are connected more than ever.
	However, it seems that every year that passes we get separated not by mountains, oceans, or canyons.
	This is a financial gap, and it's getting wider and wider due to many reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Income Inequality</p>
		<p>Differences in income and salary greatly contribute to financial inequality. In extreme cases,
		higher-ups earn more in a week than what their employees can earn in a year.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Tax Inequality</p>
		<p>Tax is the money collected by a government from its people so as to fund the government's
		projects and programs. But taxes may be higher or lower for certain groups within the country.
		In the worst cases of Tax Inequality, the rich are taxed the least while the poor taxed the most.
		This, paired with income inequality can effectively widen the gap between rich and poor.</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>Employment Inequality</p>
		<p>Most people in the lower class tend to reach only highschool-level and college-level education
		due to their lack of money, while richer people generally have better chances of finishing
		college and university. This means that after graduating, most lower class graduates work in
		minimum-wage jobs, since they are underqualified for better-paying ones. Richer people with
		better education go on to work in high-pay jobs such as in companies or services. This serves
		as a barrier for poor people to lift their way out of poverty in many countries.</p>
		</li>
	<ul>
